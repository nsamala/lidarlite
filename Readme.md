# LIDAR-Lite Library

This tidy little Arduino package gives you access to the basic functions provided by PulsedLight3D's LIDAR-Lite device.

With this, you'll be able to:

 * Get individual distance and velocity readings
 * Get smoothed (averaged) distance and velocity readings
 * Set the [velocity scaling](http://kb.pulsedlight3d.com/support/solutions/articles/5000549527-velocity-measurement)
 * Reset and calibrate the LIDAR-Lite
 * File contents are saved in the URL so you can share files

```c++
// TODO:
// add some sample code here (and in examples folder)
```

### Setup

Copy this folder into your Arduino/libraries folder (usually located in your home directory)

### Credits
